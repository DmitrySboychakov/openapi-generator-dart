[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/openapi_generator.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator)

This library is the dart/flutter implementation of openapi client sdk code generation.

With this library, you can generate openapi client sdk libraries from your openapi specification right in your
flutter/dart projects. (see example)

To be used together with [openapi-generator-annotations](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator_annotations)

## Requirements

1. **Java**: You must have java installed on your system for this library to work. if you are a developer, chances aare
   you already. Walking you through how to install Java is beyond the scope of this project.
2. **Internet Connection**: _duh!!!_  Just to download the openapi jar initially. Once it is cached, you are good to go.

## Usage

Include [openapi-generator-annotations](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator_annotations) as a dependency in the
dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml file :

```yaml
dependencies:
  openapi_generator_annotations: ^latest
```

Add [openapi-generator](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator) in the dev dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml
file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  openapi_generator: ^latest
```

Annotate any dart class with @Openapi() annotation

```dart
@Openapi(
   additionalProperties:
   DioProperties(pubName: 'petstore_api', pubAuthor: 'Johnny dep..'),
   inputSpec:
   RemoteSpec(path: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json'),
   typeMappings: {'Pet': 'ExamplePet'},
   generatorName: Generator.dio,
   runSourceGenOnOutput: true,
   outputDirectory: 'api/petstore_api',
)
class Example {}
```

Run command below to generate open api client sdk from spec file specified in annotation.

```cmd
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

The api sdk will be generated in the folder specified in the annotation. See examples for more details

As of version 6.0 of this library, there is some new functionality that has been added to the generator. This version
will have the ability to:

- `skipIfSpecUnchanged`: Set to `false` if you want the library to generate the client SDK each time, even without
  changes in the OpenAPI spec. Defaults to `true`.
- `forceAlwaysRun` (**Breaking Change**): Forces `build_runner` to detect changes by marking the annotated file. May
  cause merge conflicts in team environments, so it defaults to `false`.

## Usage (pre 5.0.0 versions)

Include [openapi-generator-annotations](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator_annotations) as a dependency in the
dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml file :

```yaml
dependencies:
   openapi_generator_annotations: ^latest
```

Add [openapi-generator](https://pub.dev/packages/openapi_generator) in the dev dependencies section of your pubspec.yaml
file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
   openapi_generator: ^latest
```

Annotate any dart class with @Openapi() annotation

```dart
@Openapi(
        additionalProperties:
        AdditionalProperties(pubName: 'petstore_api', pubAuthor: 'Johnny dep'),
        inputSpecFile: 'example/openapi-spec.yaml',
        generatorName: Generator.dart,
        outputDirectory: 'api/petstore_api')
class Example extends OpenapiGeneratorConfig {}
```

Run command below to generate open api client sdk from spec file specified in annotation.

```cmd
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

The api sdk will be generated in the folder specified in the annotation. See examples for more details

## Known Issues

### Dependency issues/conflicts

This is not an issue with this library but with flutter/dart in general. If you are having issues with dependencies,
what
you can do is make use of dependency overrides. This is added to the pubspec.yaml of the generated package and then the
pubspec
must be added to the .openapi-generator-ignore of the generated package.
For example, let's assume you want to override the analyzer package for the generated source

in generatedsource/pubspec.yaml add the following

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  analyzer: <-- preferred version -->
```

Then in generatedsources/.openapi-generator-ignore, add the below so that the pubspec is not overwritten next time you
run source gen

```.gitignore
pubspec.yaml
```

The above steps are useful when you have issues with dependency conflicts, clashes. You can even use it to upgrade the
library packages in the generated source.

### Resolving Issues with Generated Code

This library is a wrapper around [openapi generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to enable
seamless (kind of) integration into dart's build system.
The underlying generator itself is not 100% perfect mainly because it is multipurpose built and sometimes generates bad
code due to various reasons including incorrect openapi doc.
If you encounter issues with the code generated by the OpenAPI generator, there are two main ways to resolve them:

#### 1. Correct the OpenAPI Documentation

The issue might be due to incorrect or conflicting OpenAPI documentation. For instance, if a model name conflicts with
Dart's reserved names, you should edit the OpenAPI documentation to fix the issue.

#### 2. Manually Fix the Generated Code

If correcting the OpenAPI documentation is not possible or you don't have access to it, you can manually fix the
generated code.

Here are the steps to take to do this:

1. Identify the files with the bad code and manually correct them.
2. Add the manually edited files to the `.openapi-generator-ignore` file. This ensures that your changes are not
   overridden when you run the generator again.
   below is a sample of the `.openapi-generator-ignore` file. This file uses the `.gitignore` syntax and also has
   documentation in it.

```gitignore
# You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
# For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
docs/*.md
# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
!docs/README.md
path/to/corrected.dart
```

Remember to commit the `.openapi-generator-ignore` file to your git repository to preserve these changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve issues with the generated code.

## FAQ

#### Q: How do I prevent files from being generated e.g tests

A: To prevent any files from being generated, you need to add it to ```.openapi-generator-ignore```. This file is in the
root of the generated code. For example, to prevent generating tests, add ```test/*``` to the file.
